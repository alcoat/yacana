To run documentation locally, you can use the following command:  
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then, open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/index.html` to view the documentation.  
Note that you can't access pages from the index directly; for example, to view the installation page, go to:  
http://127.0.0.1:8000/pages/installation.html#installing-ollama

This is because of some URL rewriting interfering. If this is a problem for you, feel free to open an issue.
